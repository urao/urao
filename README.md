<!--
**urao/urao** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SDN and Network Automation!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many things I hope
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Kubernetes / Argo / Ansible / Python
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Juniper / Contrail-SDN / Kubernetes
